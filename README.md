# CS-210

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
- The project uploaded was our second project for this course - to create a program for Arigead Banking that would allow users to input various data and see the interest compounded. 

What did you do particularly well?
- I kept main.cpp minimal and clean (portability) and had the majority of the code written in other files. I utilized a variety of try/catch statements in order to error check input and continue running when expected errors were encountered. 

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
- The main objective of this project was to create a program to calculate potential compounded interest. There was no information saved or that could be called again after exiting the program. One enhancement could have been to write records to a file and input/output from that file for future launces (so we can import in account information and take other actions). 

Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
- I did not run into challenges in this project and found the prompt to be easy to manage. There were a variety of times I used many cout statements to debug when the program did not perform as expected. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
- From this project, I became much more familiar with try/catch statements for error checking. Previously, I had no experience using those types of statements aside from the textbook learnings.
 
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
- I used a variety of try/catch statements in order to prevent run-time errors and continuously run until the endpoint goals were achieved. I commented appropriately throughout my code to explain what each section was intended to do and used appropriate variable names in order to make it clear what the functions were doing.
